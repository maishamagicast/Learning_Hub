        <p>
          <strong>Poetry</strong> is a form of literature that emphasizes expression through rhythm, imagery, and structure. Poems often use condensed language to evoke strong emotions or create vivid imagery.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Rhyme:</strong> Repetition of similar sounds at the end of lines (e.g., "bright light").
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Meter:</strong> A pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables (e.g., iambic pentameter).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Imagery:</strong> Descriptive language that appeals to the senses (e.g., ‚ÄúThe crimson sky burned with fire‚Äù).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="elaboration">
          Example:
